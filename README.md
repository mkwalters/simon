A ripoff of simon by hasbro games


The game is currently capable of building and showing the first solution. 
Soon, I will allow player to make their moves by clicking on the buttons. 
The buttons will add ints to a list that will be checked against the master solution. 
if they're equal, the game will reset all of solutions values and rebuild them with number_of_solutions++
